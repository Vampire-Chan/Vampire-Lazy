### Want me to tell you more about myself? Then okay!
Hello, I am Vampire, just a human version of real life vampire. I love to play games, making friends, enjoying life.
Sometimes I even help those people who are not in their good state of mind. 

Gaming, Programming, Joking, Sleeping and Eating is something I enjoy a lot.
